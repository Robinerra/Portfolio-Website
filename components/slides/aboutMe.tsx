            <p>
                I&apos;m creative and have excellent problem solving skills,
                I&apos;m a quick learner and can adapt to any programming
                language or framework with ease. (except for Java)
            </p>
            <p>
                I started programming when I was 13 making Discord bots with
                javascript. That passion and love for programming has stayed
                with me to adulthood and has been a daily hobby of mine for 4
                years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computer science, Electronic engineering, Networking,
                Cybersecurity and Cryptography are all interests for me. I
                regularly play around with raspberry pis and adruinos and I have
                a fairly complicated LAN network at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of tech I enjoy playing the piano, listening to music,
                going outdoors on bike rides and hikes, going to the gym,
                cooking, being involved in local politics and volunteering in my
                community.
