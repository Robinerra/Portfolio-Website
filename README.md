# Why this isn't open source
Alright listen, I love FOSS and i'm a diehard linux user, but this is restrictive for a reason:
Why would you want to copy someone else's portfolio?

The whole point of a portfolio is to show off your *own* work and ability, it's dishonest and not in the spirit of development to use someone else's work for that purpose, and I want to discourage that behavior.

I encourage you to instead look at my work, see how I did things, and implement the idea yourself.

# The site

I used NextJS and i'm hosting on Vercel, this site weighs ~300kb and loads in 60ms for me. 

I tried to make something that looks visually appealing and feels nice to use with polished design, but that was very small and simplistic in size, and I came up with this.
